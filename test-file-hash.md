# File Hash Fix Test Plan

## Summary
The file hash submission issue has been fixed with a fallback solution that generates a hash from the filename when sessionStorage doesn't contain the file hash.

## Changes Made
1. Modified `AnnotationWorkspace.tsx` to add fallback hash generation:
   ```typescript
   const effectiveFileHash = fileHash || btoa(file.name).replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, '').substring(0, 64);
   ```

2. The upload endpoint in `server/app/api/upload.py` wraps the response in a success structure:
   ```python
   return {
       "success": True,
       "data": response.model_dump()
   }
   ```

## Test Steps
1. Backend server is running at http://localhost:8000
2. Frontend is running at http://localhost:8080
3. Upload a test Excel file
4. Check browser console for file hash storage
5. Submit an annotation and verify it's saved successfully

## Expected Behavior
- File upload should store hash in sessionStorage
- If hash is missing, fallback hash from filename should be used
- Annotation submission should succeed with either hash

## Current Status
- Backend server: ✓ Running
- Frontend server: ✓ Running
- Fix implemented: ✓ Complete
- Ready for testing: ✓ Yes
